# nasa_asteroid_classification
In our project, we are predicting the different asteroids as Hazardous and Not Hazardous based on 39 features(independent variables)         and the  1 target( Dependent variable) by using supervised  machine learning algorithm. In this we have used different types of regression model including( Linear, multiple & polynomial regression) and classification models including(Logistic, decision tree, na√Øve Bayes , Random forest, ADA boost, gradient boost, KNN) and predicted the accuracy of various models using performance measures, Hyper parameter tuning, bagging, boasting and finally predicted the most accurate model out of these models.
